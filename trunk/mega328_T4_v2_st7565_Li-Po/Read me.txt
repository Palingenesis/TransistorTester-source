This version is by Tim Jackson.1960
I have altered some of the font.h files and the bitmaps.h to show better Numbers (I think so).
If your interested in an editor for small image conversion I have done a windows application.

I thought the the results where shown too close to the Large Icon,
so I have altered the autoconfig.h so that a space can be inserted after the Icon using the Makefile.
ther is a new #definition called SPACE_FROM_ICON, this can be given a value in pixels to move the text to the right.

I have set the BAT_POOR=3200.
This is becouse I am making a version of the Chinese LCR-T4 that runs of a 3.7 Li-Po battery.
This version has a BOOST from the Li-Po and a charger for charging the Li-Po.
The PCB has been modifide so that the 10k Resistor (R3) is now directly connected to the Li-Po, not the power supply.
Thios way the Battery reading is from the Li-Po battery and not from the Power in (form the BOOST).
I will be doing an Intructable once I have finished it.
